{"name":"Bootstrap-tools","body":"###What is it?\r\nThis page is dedicated to providing more information about the code and the data used in the paper ***Making do with what you have: Use your bootstraps*** by _Guillaume Calmettes, Gordon Drummond and Sarah Vowler_ [link to be added].\r\n\r\nThis paper is part of the [Statistical Perspectives Paper Series](http://jp.physoc.org/cgi/collection/stats_reporting), initiated by the [Physiological](http://www.physoc.org/) and [Pharmacological](http://www.bps.ac.uk/view/index.html) Societies in the UK, which aims at providing clear non-technical guidance for authors on best practice in statistical testing and data presentation.\r\n\r\nThe code is written in the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language, and requires the [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) library which provides support for array manipulation.\r\n\r\n###Where to get it?\r\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: https://github.com/gcalmettes/bootstrap-tools.\r\nYou can directly view it or download it from the links at the top of this page.\r\n\r\n###What is inside?\r\nFour bootstrap methods are provided in the source code:\r\n\r\n- `bootstrap`: generates x bootstrap samples from a given data. The number of bootstrap samples\r\n(_10000_ by default) as well as the replacement method (_replacement=True_ by default)\r\ncan be tweaked.\r\nAll of the other functions of the package are based on this function.\r\n- `bootci`: computes the confidence intervals of a statistic of a given data,\r\nusing the [Bootstrap Percentile Interval][1] method.\r\nBy default the analysed statistic is the mean, and the level of confidence is 0.05\r\n(95% confidence interval). _Note:_ the Bias-Corrected Accelerated Interval method, will be\r\nadded in a near future.\r\n- `bootpv`: computes the one-tailed pvalue of a statistics (_mean_ by default) when comparing\r\ntwo data samples.\r\n- `bootci_diff`: computes the confidence intervals of the difference of a statistic\r\n(_mean_ by default) when comparing two data samples.\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the docstring of the functions to know more about the options available for each of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n###How does it work? (Practical example)\r\n\r\nLet us use the data described in the paper, and provided in the `data` folder of the\r\nsource code. The data represent the jump distances of two different groups of frogs,\r\none from\r\nthe north of California and one from the region of Calaveras, where escapees\r\nfrom the jumping competition have interbred with native frogs.\r\n\r\n####Inspection of the data\r\nThe top-left panel of the\r\nfigure below shows the distribution of the jumps for the two groups of frogs.\r\nLet us take the 50 first data points of each group of frogs as samples to work with\r\n(top-right panel).\r\n\r\n![fig-samples](images/fig-samples.png)\r\n\r\nSuppose we want to **compare estimates of the two populations from which these samples\r\nhave been drawn**.\r\nFirst, let us inspect a [Quantile-Quantile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-Q_plot)\r\nplot of our samples (bottom panels).\r\nQ-Q plots give us a visual check whether a sample follows a specific distribution, by\r\ncomparing the quantiles of two distributions against each other.\r\nThe case that we are interested in most often, is a test for \r\n[normality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).\r\nHere, as suggested by the points not following a linear pattern, it\r\nturns out that our samples are not consistent with a _normal distribution_,\r\nmaking difficult to use statistical tools based on the assumption of\r\n_normal distribution_ of the data. The bootstrap method, however, does not need\r\nsuch a strong assumption, and therefore can be used to analyze our data.\r\n\r\n\r\n####Bootstrap of the mean of the data\r\n(available soon)\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)#Methods_for_bootstrap_confidence_intervals\r\n","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
